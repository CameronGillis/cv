        <h3>Development and Design</h3>
        <p>I started coding in high school around 14 years old. I've played video games my whole life, so computers and their functions greatly appealed to me.
          Currently looking for a career, I'm seeking to make web, mobile and desktop applications, or design websites and databases.</p>

        <h3>Playing Drums</h3>
        <p>When I was 10 years old, I played <em>Guitar Hero</em> a lot. The drums were my favorite to play. It was all about rhythm and feeling the music.
          Ever since then, I've loved drumming and have been rockin' for 13 years! I can play most styles of music, excluding ones where drums are not a focus.
          I was the former drummer of hard rock band<a href="https://www.lunarfreefall.com">Lunar Freefall</a> from 2016 to 2021.
          I had to leave the band in July 2021 to lock in my career.
          I now serve on the worship team for my church,<a href="https://www.summitchurchdc.com/">Summit Church DC</a>.</p>
